# TextMining
These are Java source files for Text Mining class project during my graduate study at University of Virginia.
The file "DocAnalyzer.java" is the main entrance for the project.
The files in the "VSM_LM" package are programs for building the Language Model and the Vector Space Model for a Yelp review corpus.
The files in "TextClassifier" package are different Machine Learning programs that can train classifiers to classify the review into positive or negative.
